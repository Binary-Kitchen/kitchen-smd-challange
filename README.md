# Nibble++
A simple PCP to test your SMD hand-soldering skills. Going down to sand grain sized 01005 SMD parts, this button is a challenge for experienced "soldiers" and those who want to become one.

## Idea
The Idea origins to Ken Olsen and his Attiny SMD Challenge. Many thanks to Ken Olsen for the idear and for opening up this great work to creative commons.

## Name
The name Nibble++ origins from a simple [nibble peg](https://github.com/Binary-Kitchen/SolderingTutorial/tree/master/NibblePegDIP) which has been developed one year earlier. A Nibble ist a unit for the amount of 4 Bits (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble). Because we are using five LEDs we incremented the value ;).
